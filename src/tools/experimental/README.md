# Experimental Tools

**Last Updated**: January 14, 2025
**Status**: EXPERIMENTAL / NOT VERIFIED

This folder contains tools that are experimental or have unverified functionality:
- Non-functional endpoints
- Unverified algorithms
- Missing data sources
- Complex calculations not validated

## Experimental Tools (7 files)

### Non-Functional Endpoints
1. **analyzePublicAdjusterPipeline.ts** - Endpoint not verified working
   - **Issue**: API endpoint may not exist or return correct data
   - **Risk**: May fail in production

2. **getCustomerLifetimeValue.ts** - Complex calculation unverified
   - **Issue**: CLV formula not validated against real data
   - **Risk**: May provide incorrect business insights

3. **getSupplierComparison.ts** - No supplier data in JobNimbus
   - **Issue**: JobNimbus doesn't track supplier information
   - **Risk**: Will always return empty/synthetic data

4. **getInventoryManagementAnalytics.ts** - No inventory system
   - **Issue**: JobNimbus doesn't have inventory management features
   - **Risk**: Will always return empty/synthetic data

5. **getQualityControlAnalytics.ts** - No QC data in JobNimbus
   - **Issue**: JobNimbus doesn't track quality control metrics
   - **Risk**: Will always return empty/synthetic data

6. **getSmartScheduling.ts** - Unverified optimization algorithms
   - **Issue**: Complex scheduling logic not tested at scale
   - **Risk**: May provide poor scheduling recommendations

7. **getCustomerJourneyAnalytics.ts** - Limited touchpoint data
   - **Issue**: JobNimbus has limited customer journey tracking
   - **Risk**: Incomplete journey maps

## Before Using These Tools

⚠️ **WARNING**: These tools are experimental and may:
- Return empty or synthetic data
- Fail silently
- Provide incorrect business insights
- Have performance issues

## Verification Needed

To move a tool to production:
1. Verify API endpoint exists and works
2. Test with real data from multiple accounts
3. Validate calculations/algorithms
4. Add error handling
5. Document limitations clearly
6. Get stakeholder sign-off

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] API endpoint verified (Postman/curl)
- [ ] Real data tested (3+ accounts)
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<2s)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Stakeholder approval
