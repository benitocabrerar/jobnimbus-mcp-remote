# Archived: Redundant Custom Tools

**Date Archived:** 2025-01-14
**Reason:** Redundant functionality - better alternatives exist

## What Was Archived

2 custom tools with duplicate or inferior functionality:

### 1. `analyze_job_attachments`
**Replaced by:** `get_job_attachments_distribution`

**Why Archived:**
- `get_job_attachments_distribution` provides the same attachment analysis with better categorization
- Uses native JobNimbus `record_type_name` field (20+ categories vs 6 custom categories)
- More accurate distribution matching JobNimbus UI
- Better performance with pagination and caching

**Migration:**
```typescript
// OLD (archived):
analyze_job_attachments(job_id="1820", max_files=10)

// NEW (recommended):
get_job_attachments_distribution(job_id="1820", page_size=300)
// Returns complete distribution: Photos, Documents, Invoices, Permit,
// Estimate, Measurements, Insurance Scopes, Material Receipts, etc.
```

### 2. `search_insurance_jobs`
**Replaced by:** `search_jobs_enhanced`

**Why Archived:**
- `search_jobs_enhanced` provides same insurance filtering plus more business types
- Supports insurance, retail, hybrid, and unknown business types
- Includes business type categorization with confidence scores
- More flexible with additional filters (carrier, claim status, deductible ranges)

**Migration:**
```typescript
// OLD (archived):
search_insurance_jobs(carrier_name="State Farm", min_claim_value=5000)

// NEW (recommended):
search_jobs_enhanced(
  business_type="insurance",
  insurance_carrier="State Farm",
  min_claim_value=5000
)
// Plus additional options: insurance_status, adjuster, supplements, etc.
```

## Why These Were Redundant

| Tool | Issue | Better Alternative |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| `analyze_job_attachments` | Custom 6-category classification vs native 20+ categories | `get_job_attachments_distribution` |
| `search_insurance_jobs` | Insurance-only search vs multi-business-type search | `search_jobs_enhanced` |

## Impact

- **Token Efficiency:** Reduced tool count by 2 additional tools
- **Maintenance:** Removed duplicate logic and categorization
- **User Experience:** Single tool per use case instead of multiple overlapping tools
- **Accuracy:** Native JobNimbus categorization instead of custom logic

## Detailed Comparison

### Attachment Analysis Tools

**analyze_job_attachments (ARCHIVED):**
- Custom classification logic (6 categories)
- AI-powered visual analysis
- Text extraction from PDFs
- Limited file type support

**get_job_attachments_distribution (RECOMMENDED):**
- Native JobNimbus record_type_name (20+ categories)
- Accurate distribution matching UI
- Complete file metadata
- Pagination support (up to 500 files)
- Attachment count verification
- Time range analysis

**Verdict:** `get_job_attachments_distribution` is superior for distribution analysis. For AI analysis of specific files, use `get_attachments` + external AI tools.

### Insurance Job Search Tools

**search_insurance_jobs (ARCHIVED):**
- Insurance business type only
- Basic filtering (carrier, claim value, status)
- Custom categorization logic
- Limited to insurance workflows

**search_jobs_enhanced (RECOMMENDED):**
- Multi-business-type support (insurance, retail, hybrid, unknown)
- Intelligent categorization with confidence scores
- All insurance filters plus retail filters
- Flexible query system
- Better performance with optimized queries

**Verdict:** `search_jobs_enhanced` provides all functionality of `search_insurance_jobs` plus retail and hybrid support.

## Restoration

If these tools need to be restored, the files are preserved in this directory:
- `analyzeJobAttachments.ts`
- `searchInsuranceJobs.ts`

To restore:
1. Move files back to original locations
2. Add imports back to `src/tools/index.ts`
3. Register tools in the ToolRegistry constructor
4. Rebuild and deploy

**Note:** Consider whether the superior alternatives (`get_job_attachments_distribution` and `search_jobs_enhanced`) already meet your needs before restoring.
